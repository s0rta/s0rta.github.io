      Here to flourish in the lag time, build a mahogany bench, and eat icecream
      with as many strangers as possible. Passionate about nerd junk, the
      intersection of technology and art, human curration, bread baking, indie
      hacking, painting on your clothes, tea, growing plants with your
      community, punk junk. Interested in the stuff folks are passionate about,
      whatever it is. All my friends are artists. Always looking for folks to
      talk to and build stuff with, specially in the twin cities area
